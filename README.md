web application type: incident report management

TODO list:
1. decide on what needs to be included in the database ✔
    - incident type (injury, verbal or physical altercation, employee error, etc)
    - time of incident
    - incident location
    - involved parties
    - incident overview
    - damages (property, monetary, etc)
    - incident state (active or addressed)
2. create mongoDB database (William can do this as the current db.js links to his mongodb) ✔
3. create home page ✔
4. update NAVBAR to properly link pages ✔
5. create an option next to each element on /incidents to view full incident report (only show full details of 1 incident instead of a summery of all incidents)
6. display incidents sorted by active and most recent first
7. develop backend to perform CRUD operations ✔
8. make it look semi readable (does not have to be good) ✔

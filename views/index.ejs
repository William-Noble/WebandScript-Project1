    We have decided to create an incident management site, where the user can
    create, update, and delete incidents from a database. 
    <br>An incident can be created, updated/edited, or deleted on the 'Incidents' page.
    <br>To go to the Incidents page, simply click on the 'Incidents' navbar button on the top right.
    <br>A list of incidents reported previously will appear, which can be edited to deleted.
    <br>Click 'Add Incident' to create a new Incident. Details such as the incident type, time,
    location, involved parties, overview, damages, and state of the incident need to be filled out before it can be submitted.
